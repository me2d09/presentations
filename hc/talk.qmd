# Introduction

## Why Specific Heat?

- **Fundamental Insight**:
    - How solids store thermal energy
    - Linked to:
      - **lattice vibrations (phonons)**
      - **electrons**
      - **magnetic excitations**.
  
- The **first experiment** to characterize new materials.


# Einstein Model of Specific Heat

## Basic Assumptions


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Einstein modeled a solid as **N particles**, each oscillating independently in 3D.
- The oscillators have the **same frequency** $\nu_E$.
- Each particle behaves like a **quantum harmonic oscillator**.

$$
E = \sum \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) h\nu_E
$$

## Einstein Model limits


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**High Temperatures**

- $C_V$ approaches the **Dulong-Petit** limit:
    
    $$
    C_V \approx 3R
    $$

    where $R$ is the gas constant.
:::

**Low Temperatures**

- Fewer oscillators are excited:
    
    $$
    C_V \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as} \quad T \rightarrow 0
    $$

- Einstein introduced the concept of **quantized energy levels**, explaining the decrease in specific heat at low $T$.

## Limitations of the Einstein Model

The Einstein model **fails** at very low temperatures.

- In reality, the **vibrational frequencies** are not all the same.
- This leads to a **discrepancy** between theory and experimental results, particularly at low $T$.

    $$
    C_V^{exp} > C_V^{theory}
    $$

- This limitation is addressed by the **Debye model**.


# Debye Model of Specific Heat

## Key Concept


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Debye treated solids as a **phonon gas** (vibrations of atoms as sound waves) rather than independent oscillators.
- Phonons follow **Bose-Einstein statistics**.

## Simple math

![](/mass_spring_diagram.svg)

$$
M \frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2 }=\alpha(u_{n+1} - u_n )+ \alpha(u_{n-1} - u_n )
$$


$$
u_n=Ae^{i(qX_n - \omega t)}
$$


## Simple math

![](/mass_spring_diagram.svg)

Boundary conditions: $u_1=u_n$

Solution is $\omega=2\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{M}} \sin(qa/2)$


## Think about solution. Why it is periodic? { .smaller }

$\omega=2\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{M}} \sin(qa/2)$


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define constants
alpha = 1.0  # spring constant
M = 1.0      # mass
a = 1.0      # lattice constant

# Define the function for omega with absolute value
def omega_abs(q):
    return 2 * np.sqrt(alpha / M) * np.abs(np.sin(q * a / 2))

# Create an array of q values
q_values = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 500)

# Calculate omega for each q with absolute value
omega_values_abs = omega_abs(q_values)

# Plot the updated function
plt.plot(q_values, omega_values_abs, label=r'$\omega=2\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{M}} |\sin(qa/2)|$')
plt.xlabel('q')
plt.ylabel(r'$\omega$')
plt.title(r'Dispersion Relation: $\omega=2\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{M}} |\sin(qa/2)|$')
plt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.grid(False)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Phonon simulation

see:
[PHY.K02UF Molecular and Solid State Physics](https://lampz.tugraz.at/~hadley/ss1/phonons/1d/1dphonons.php)

- The distribution of phonon frequencies extends up to a maximum value $\nu_D$, called the **Debye frequency**.

    $$
    g(\nu) \propto \nu^2
    $$
    for $\nu \leq \nu_D$.


## Heat Capacity in the Debye Model

- **Low Temperatures** - Debye’s $T^3$ Law:
    
    $$
    C_V \propto T^3
    $$

    - Excellent agreement with experimental results at low temperatures.

- **High Temperatures** - classical **Dulong-Petit** law.

    $$
    C_V \approx 3R
    $$



# Experimental Methods for Measuring Specific Heat

## Calorimetry

**Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)**

 - Measures heat flow as temperature changes.

**Adiabatic calorimetry**

 - Measures heat required to change temperature in a well-isolated system.
  

## Two-Tau Model in Quantum Design PPMS

- The **Two-Tau Model** is used in PPMS systems to measure the specific heat of materials.
- It involves analyzing heat flow through a sample using two characteristic time constants $\tau$

    1. $\tau_{\text{sample}}$ – Thermal relaxation time of the sample.
    2. $\tau_{\text{addenda}}$ – Thermal relaxation time of the sample holder and addenda.

## Experimental Setup

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

- The sample is mounted on a **platform** with a known heat capacity (addenda).
- A **heater** applies a controlled amount of heat to the sample.
- A **thermometer** monitors the temperature of both the sample and the addenda.

## Key Steps in Measurement


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

1. **Heat Pulse** is applied to the sample and addenda.
  
2. **Thermal Relaxation** curves are recorded.
  
3. **Data Fitting** using **two-tau model**
    - Accurate separation of the specific heat of the sample from the addenda.

## Two-Tau Model

The temperature relaxation is fitted by two exponential decays:
  
$$
    T(t) = T_0 + A_1 e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_1}} + A_2 e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_2}}
$$
  
where: 

- $T_0$ is the equilibrium temperature.
- $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are time constants for the sample and addenda.

 
The fitting parameters $A_1$, $A_2$, $\tau_1$, and $\tau_2$ are used to calculate the **specific heat** $C_p$ of the sample.
  

## Practical Considerations

- Proper thermal contact between the sample and platform is critical for accurate measurements.
- Care must be taken to ensure that the addenda’s heat capacity is well-characterized across the temperature range.
- Machine is a black box, don't use it as a black box!

## Two-Tau Model - Semi-Adiabatic {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Advantages

- **Improved Accuracy**: More precise separation of sample heat capacity from addenda.
- **Applicable for Small Samples**: Effective for small samples where the addenda can dominate the heat capacity signal.
- **Wider Temperature Range**: Works over a broad temperature range, especially useful for low-temperature measurements in the PPMS.

### Disadvantages 

- **Slow**: One point could be minutes.
- **Point separation**: could miss first order phase transitions

# Long Pulse Heat Capacity Measurement

## When you don't have enough time

- **Semi-Adiabatic Method**:
  - A short heat pulse is applied, and heat capacity is derived using exponential fits.
  - Limitations: Time-consuming and not accurate for first-order transitions.

- **Long-Pulse Method**:
  - A long heat pulse (~30 min) is applied, and heat capacity is computed from the time derivative of sample temperature.
  - More efficient and sensitive to first-order transitions.

## Software: LongHCPulse {.smaller}

[arxiv:1705.07129](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07129)

 - Compute and plot heat capacity using the long-pulse method.
 - Corrects for noise, temperature recalculations, and inconsistencies in PPMS software.

Performance and Results

 - Accuracy: Long pulse is consistent and aligns with semi-adiabatic short-pulse data.
 - Significantly reduces measurement time and increases sensitivity ( 5x faster than standard methods).
 - More self-consistent compared to standard PPMS MultiVu software.
